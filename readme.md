Welcome to my Ecommerce API!

This API uses Flask & SQLAlchamey to communicate with the database & server!

We're able to do so by using the SQLAlchamey ORM's Declarative base model to
create classes for our database tables.

We use flask-marshmallow to create schemas that allows us to serialize and 
de-serialize our table data. These schemas come in handy when communication our
python data to the server.
